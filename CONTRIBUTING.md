# Contributing to the list

**Pull requests are welcome**, but keep this in mind:

- Projects must have a [free](https://gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html) license. If they lack a license, get to the original maintainer and ask them to add a license.
- Follow the existing style: `your name/project name â€“ project description`, make sure you are using [en dash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash#En_dash) symbol.
- All projects must be under the author's educational program.
- Sort in alphabetical order by name.

If you don't know how to use pull requests, you can also create an issue.
