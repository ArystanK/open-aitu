# Contributing to the list

**Pull requests are welcome**, but keep this in mind:

- Projects must have a [free](https://gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html) license. If they lack a license, author must add it.
- Follow the existing style: `full name/project name â€“ project description`, make sure that [en dash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash#En_dash) symbol is used.
- All projects must be under the author's educational program.
- Projects must be sorted in alphabetical order by author's first name and last name.
- If there is more than one entry of the same author they must be sorted by alphabetical order.

If you don't know how to use pull requests, you can also create an issue.
